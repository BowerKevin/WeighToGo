BeaverHacks Fall 2020 Project

Weigh To Go

This project is a team collaboration. My team and I utilized Flask as the framework and used Python, Html, and CSS, and Bootstrap to format the webpage. The purpose of this website is to show the user the appropriate number of plates needed to execute their workout. The website is hosted using PythonAnywhere. 

This was a very rewarding and enjoyable experience. Neither I nor by teammates had worked with Flask or had any Web Development experience prior
to this Hackathon. There was a steep learning curve especially with the form validation and route handling.

Overall, this was tremendous learning experience!
